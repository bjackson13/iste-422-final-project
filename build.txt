/*Brennan Jackson - Deployment Exercise*/

To build a deployment and .jar file for the project:

1. Make sure that gradle is installed. You can check gradle's status by running the command: 'gradle --version'
	**Note: if you do not have gradle installed, we have included the gradle wrapper to use intead. Simply subsititue 'gradle' in all commands with either './graldew' (*nix or mac os) 'gradle.bat' (Windows)

2. Make sure that the java project files are structured as follows:

.
+--build.gradle
+--src
   +--main
      +--java
         +--*.java
   +--test
      +--java
         +--*.java

3. (OPTIONAL) To build just the jar file for the project, run the command 'gradle jar'. The resulting jar file can be found in the 'build/libs' directory.

4. To build the entire project, including the jar file along with running test classes, generating tar and zip files, and more, use the command: 'gradle build'

That's it. Using either the command found in step 3 or 4 you can successfully build the project and jar file in a single command!

**For instructions on how to run the command, see README**
