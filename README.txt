Brennan Jackson - ISTE-422 Project

How to run the project:

1. Follow the steps in Build.txt to either generate the jar file or build the project entirely

2. (Jar only no gradle) To run just the jar file, navigate to the directory your project is saved to in your terminal or command prompt. Enter the command: 'java -jar buid/libs/EdgeConvert.jar'

3. (Using gradle) To run the project using gradle, simply enter the command: 'gradle run'. This command will build the project if it is not already built, tests will be run prior to the program launching too.
